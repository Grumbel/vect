    A simple Vector-Graphic editor for Retriever.

Vect is a simple vector graphics editor coded back in 1998 using
Allegro/DOS. As of 2015, it still compiles under Linux with only a few
minor tweaks. It's not exactly very feature rich, but it is able to
produce some graphics. Examples are provided.


Compilation
-----------

Vect requires Allegro, which can be found under Ubuntu in the package
`liballegro4-dev`. Compilation works via `cmake`:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
